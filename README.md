#### Code
_You can stylize t he keypad based on class names
Find the class names through the git repo_

#### Settings
Settings are self-explanatory so I will only provide comments on the ones that are not straightforward.

* Mask Character - this will mask the output box
* Clear on Submit - if this is checked, the model is also cleared. This will NOT clear your item, only the UI client side.
* Output Box Clickable - if enabled, you will be able to click on the box just like an input box.
* Units - Some of the settings require UNITs so do not forget to include them. 
* Background - You can set using any CSS-valid value. Examples:
  * url('//path/to/an/online/image')
  * inherit
  * blace
  * transparent
